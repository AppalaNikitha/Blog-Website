- The Blog Website Project provides users with full functionality to manage articles seamlessly.
- Users can initiate by creating new articles via a dedicated button, which leads to a submission form. On the homepage, each article is prominently displayed with its title, date, and a brief summary.
- Users can choose to read the full content of any article, edit its content to update information, or delete it entirely from the blog. Behind the scenes, a robust backend manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring efficient content management.
- The interface prioritizes user-friendliness, enabling effortless publishing and maintenance of blog posts for all users.
